					<div class="panel-body">
						There are a number of different travel options for reaching
						Coimbra, Portugal. Here we have put together details on how to get
						to Coimbra by train, plain, bus and car. <br></br> <i
							class="fa fa-plane"></i><br></br>If you are wondering how to get
						to Coimbra by air, it is possible both via Lisbon and via Porto
						airports. Coimbra is located slightly closer to Porto, however
						there are more flights into Portela Airport in Lisbon, due to its
						status as Portugal’s capital city. The onward journey from both is
						relatively straightforward, with Porto to Coimbra taking around an
						hour and Lisbon to Coimbra taking around two hours, either by road
						or train. <br></br> <i class="fa fa-train"></i><br></br>
						Travelling to Coimbra by train is simple. All trains between these
						two cities stop at Coimbra en route, some on a fast service and
						some on a slower-stopping service. When travelling to Coimbra by
						train, whether you travel from Porto to Coimbra or from Lisbon to
						Coimbra, your journey will bring you into Coimbra B station, which
						is a short distance from the city centre. However, all
						long-distance tickets include the five-minute ride to Coimbra A,
						also known as “Baixa de Coimbra”, or downtown, which is located
						right in the heart of the city centre. Travelling to Coimbra by
						bus is a comfortable and cost-effective alternative to the train.
						You can reach Coimbra by bus from destinations all over Portugal,
						including the far northern and eastern borders with Spain and from
						locations on the Algarve in the south. <br></br> <i
							class="fa fa-bus"></i><br></br> If you choose to arrive in
						Coimbra by bus, your journey will end at the bus station in Av.
						Fernao de Magalhaes, just a 10-minute walk from the city centre
						and all the major hotels. <br></br> <i class="fa fa-car"></i><br></br>
						Travelling to Coimbra by car is a popular option for those looking
						to explore the local area. If you are thinking of travelling to
						Coimbra by car, take the A1 motorway which runs from Lisbon to
						Porto and choose one of the Coimbra exits which will lead you into
						the city centre.

						<strong>Coimbra - History</strong>
						<p></p>
						This city holds a special place in the hearts of all the
						Portuguese. Rich in its history and is the oldest seat of learning
						in Portugal with a University founded on the 13th of August in
						1290 by King Dinis. This makes it one of the oldest in the world.
						Coimbra was liberated from Moor occupation in 1064 and was then
						developed as a town by the capable Conde de Sesmundo who was the
						master here for 27 years. Six of Portugal’s Kings were born here
						and between 1139 and 1256 it was the chosen capital of the
						country. The name of this city during the Roman period was
						Aeminium, and but it later developed under the influence of the
						greater nearby town of Conimbriga. This latter place is now an
						important archaeological site of great interest with a museum to
						display the findings from the diggings. At first sight the town
						appears more devoted to commerce than learning but the skyline
						above the lower part of the city suggest its real purpose.

						<span id="three"></span>Environmental Commitment
					</h2>
					<div class="content width-640 floatRight">
						<p>During the last decade, in which independent music has been
							the driving force of Primavera Sound, we have experienced the
							international awakening to a serious, global problem: the climate
							change.</p>
						<p>Being aware of the fact that life in modern society
							inevitably leaves a carbon footprint, the organizers of the
							festival are firmly determined to evaluate its environmental
							impact and to make the decisions and implement the measures to
							reduce this impact and to offset it.</p>
						<p>Some of the initiatives undertaken during the previous
							editions of the festival have shown us that, by making an effort
							and putting in resources, it is possible to obtain positive
							results in the reduction of our environmental impact.</p>
						<p>Actions like selective waste collection, using of more
							sustainable materials and reduction and inventory of green house
							gas emissions, amongst other measures, will be added to the
							festival’s organisation and logistics.</p>
						<p>And audience, the real protagonist, will have a lot to say
							in this domain. For this reason we have drawn up a short list of
							good environmental practices that we encourage you to follow,
							both during the festival and beyond. Help us to reduce the
							environmental impact of the festival and to fight against climate
							change.</p>
						<p>1. Come on by foot, by bicycle or using the public
							transport. It’s 100% effective and easy for the duration of the
							festival!</p>
						<p>2. Reuse your cup if you want to drink the same beverage</p>
						<p>3. If you want to drink water use the drinking water
							fountains. Thus avoiding excessive use of plastic bottles</p>
						<p>4. Try to order and consume low packaged and/or locally
							made products</p>
						<p>5. Use the recycling bins to collect separately the waste.</p>
						<p>6. Look after the trees and plants: they are our allies in
							the fight against climate change. Use the special WC!</p>
						<p>7. Don’t waste water</p>
						<p>We count on you to make Primavera greener!</p>
