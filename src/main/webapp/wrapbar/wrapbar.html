1.2. It is understood that access to or the mere use of the Website on behalf of the User implies adherence to these General Conditions, which MADELIA SOUND keeps posted and makes available at all times for those who access the Website. Therefore, the User should carefully read these General Conditions. <br><br>

By “User” we mean the people who access, navigate, use and/or participate in the services and activities, whether free or paying, developed on the Website. <br><br>
1.3. The purpose of these General Conditions is to regulate access, navigation and use of the Website; however, independently of these, MADELIA SOUND may establish Particular Conditions regulating the use and/or the contracting of specific services offered to Users through the Website. Likewise, through the Website, MADELIA SOUND may authorise third parties to advertise and offer their services. In these cases, MADELIA SOUND will not be responsible for establishing the General and/or Particular Conditions governing the use, provision or contracting of services by third parties, and, therefore, will not be considered responsible for them in any way. <br><br>

1.4. Before using and/or contracting said specific services provided by MADELIA SOUND, the User should carefully read the corresponding Particular Conditions created, in such cases, by MADELIA SOUND itself. The use and/or contracting of said specific services implies the acceptance of the Particular Conditions that regulate them,  in the version published by MADELIA SOUND at the time that said usage and/or contracting takes place. <br><br>


<strong> 2. INDUSTRIAL AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</strong> <br><br>
